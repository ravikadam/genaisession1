"Q. As you probably know, we have written many stories about OYO and have often asked harsh questions as well. So I was curious, why did you agree to take this meeting?"
"I have never believed that your intentions were wrong. From my perspective, your stories may have some interpretation, some information or some perception that may seem wrong. And I can use this opportunity to at least share our side of the story."
"Q. So let’s hear your side of the story, starting from the very beginning. What was the original idea behind OYO?"
"I started with Oravel. Oravel was modelled on Airbnb and was a semi-OTA (Online Travel Aggregator) of sorts, primarily offering vacation homes and guest houses like how companies like Stayzilla used to offer at that point of time. However, what I realised is if you try and do something like that, you have to fight the chicken and egg battle—you have to fight the battle of attracting consumers and also the battle of ensuring supply.The problem, as I saw it, was not that there weren’t enough hotels in India—there has always been enough supply of hotel rooms to cater to demand at all price points. The problem was that for budget travellers, the hotel experience was often broken. Unlike in premium hotels where the user experience was not just standardised but also predictable—irrespective of which city the traveller went to—staying in a budget hotel was a hit-and-miss experience and usually unpredictable. Our brand promise with OYO was that for roughly Rs 1,500 (US$20) per night, a traveller would get a clean room of a minimum specified size with AC, WiFi, and free breakfast. I believed that such a value proposition would fly off the shelves.So I pivoted Oravel to Oravel Inns and offered this service myself. From there, we moved to the OYO avatar and tied up with other hotel partners to offer this standardised, predictable offering countrywide."
"Q. That is an interesting back story. While this may well have been a true market gap, what made you believe that this was a value proposition that could be monetised at scale? Even if you could monetise it, how would OYO make money from a room that charges Rs 800 (US$10.5), Rs 1,000 (US$13) or Rs 1,500 per night?"
"So here’s the thing. I think one of the things that has not been very well understood about our model is the key driver of unit economics. If you speak to folks at Treebo or Fab Hotels, I’m sure you will hear the same things. People think that the average room rent, or ARR in hotel parlance, is the most important metric. It is not. What is far more important is RevPar or Revenue per available room. For a long time, asset owners operated in a manner where they said that “Because I invested so much capital expenditure, I require Rs 3,000 (US$39.5) or Rs 2,000 (US$26) in the form of earning from this room”. But the occupancy remained very slimFor instance, if you have a room with Rs 3,000 ARR but a 20% occupancy, your RevPar becomes Rs 600 (US$8). So, the first important criteria for us was to explain that a room of Rs 1000 with 80% occupancy is better than one at Rs 3,000 with just 20% occupancy. If your occupancy is higher, you can easily get 25-30% higher net revenue outcome even if your rates are lower. Very simple principle, right? Anybody who understands any fixed cost business will understand the difference between the price and volume. Our value proposition to the hotel owner was that we will help you get these higher occupancy rates and split the proceeds."
Q. Was OYO the first to offer this type of model? Weren’t entities like Ginger also offering similar services earlier
"Yes, Ginger was there when we launched—they used to offer their rooms at Rs 999, which became a sort of a benchmark for us as well. But they got two things wrong.One, as soon as they got some demand, they ramped up prices to Rs 2,800 or Rs 2,900 (~US$38). Did they get some short-term RevPar lift? They did. But that dramatically reduced their scale. Because what happened is that they had a certain type of demographic using them but when they increased the price, they became affordable to a much smaller segment of the population —what I call the “credit card customer base”, the 25-30 million Indians who have credit cards.On the other hand, we continue to remain sharply focussed on the larger demographic of budget travellers.The second thing that Ginger did, as did others like IBIS, was what they called “No khaana (food)”—they said breakfast will only be at the lobby. For that, too, you will have to pay more. They also squeezed the size of the room. I felt that both of these practices were customer-unfriendly."
Q. How much of your business is from repeat customers?
"I think corporate is very critical. Basically, corporate for us is two parts—one is corporate employees who use an app and book with us. The second is corporate employees who use the OYO Wizard programme. OYO in India has partnered over 5,000 corporations, including many small and medium businesses. Pre-Covid, we got 20% of our revenue from this stream, what we call MM or micro-market business.Regarding our overall national business, 70-75% of our revenue comes from repeat customers. And around 15-17% revenue comes from what we call organic customers. Organic is very simple—people who don’t need advertisements to come stay with us. People will just go to the OYO App, search for a hotel and come; Or if there is a corporate, where there were three employees who used to come and then a fourth employee started coming. So wherever you did not have an incremental expenditure marginal cost to bring the customerAnd this is India only, let me clarify. OYO India would have roughly 90% revenue for which you did not spend marketing dollars. But relatively, Southeast Asia will follow where we see this in the range of 55 to 60%. Our OYO Vacation homes business in Europe will follow, which will be roughly 50%. And then everything else."
"Q. Normally, one would think that repeat customers making up the bulk of revenue isn’t necessarily good as that means you’re not bringing in more people into the top of the funnel. How would you reconcile that, especially since your revenues have gone up 4X from 2018 to 2019, but 90% of the same people coming in? How does that work?"
"Yeah, I think, first off, the 4X jump is significantly driven by some of the global expansion. But that said, you’re right. A large part of revenue growth is still being driven by the same customers.I have always believed that in India, if you build a business designed on the back of marketing dollars, it’s very hard to make money because how many marketing channels do you have overall? You have Google, Facebook, and then television. I can’t afford television, and Google and Facebook will squeeze out every dollar I make because there is MakeMyTrip, Expedia, and the big guys who are bidding on those.So for me, the belief has been to figure out—“What does a customer in India demand?”—and provide that. My customers tell me that they are looking for a clean and affordable room in a good location. We give them that and that is why they come. And the signage outside the hotel is how you get to the top of the funnel. I am very focussed on conversion and not so much on traffic. Because I believe if you have the best conversion metrics, you can create a virtuous cycle.Now remember, this is my philosophy and I’ve been challenged a lot on this, including by my chief financial officer, my chief marketing officer, and my chief strategy officer. Everybody challenges me saying, “Ritesh, you’re too obsessed with conversion.” But I believe in it because India is supply-constrained as far as quality options are concernedThat’s the mindset I have operated with for a long period of time now, for good or for bad. It doesn’t mean we don’t try new top-of-the-funnel things. But so far, our occupancy has done okay for all the new hotels we opened with the repeat customers primarily."
"Q. So what is the top-of-the-funnel split right now between the direct customers, the OTAs, and walk-ins?"
"In India, I think a majority of our business—in the range of 93-94%—would be from non-OTA channels.For most of our competitors, this number may be dramatically lower because they depend highly on OTAs, specifically Booking.com and Trivago, to funnel business. Our model works the best for hotel partners as well because they don’t need to give double commission, first to the brand and the second to the online travel agency.If I were to split that 93% further, the majority of it will be through online channels—the app and browser—so I would say probably 65% or so. You would anticipate around 20% more from corporate/enterprise sales. And then you’d have 6% primarily through walk-ins."
"Q. If you have such a high percentage of direct customers and an equally high percentage of repeat customers, why is there a perception, at least on social media, of widespread consumer resentment against OYO? A social media search shows a vast number of people complaining the experience was substandard. Similarly OYO’s customer satisfaction scores on OTAs like Booking.com are often very low. How do you reconcile that?"
"The headline answer is OYO has served 19 million customers in India, and we have many more app downloads. And these are consumers who we have full details of, some consumers we may or may not have full details of like walk-ins, and so on and so forth."
"90% of our revenue comes from repeat and word of mouth. So, there are definitely some customers who are happy about coming back to OYO. At the same time, there are definitely some customers who are unhappy. And if you compare that to any other leading startups in India like Ola or Swiggy, you will get thousands of complaints for each of those brands on social media. That doesn’t mean that a large percent of our customers are unhappy. But one of the big changes that I’m trying to architect is bringing in a culture of “No problem is too  small; Every customer is critical”."
"In terms of perceptions about customer satisfaction rating, a lot of times our competitors love to show our Booking.com scores in India and say, “Oh, look at OYO scores that are not so good”. What people forget is OYO gets a decimal point worth of business from Booking.com. And most of these ratings are ones that we inherited from the past. The number of hotels listed on Booking.com is also small. So it’s not just not representative."
"We get many multiples of that booking just from MakeMyTrip and GoIbibo. If you look at MakeMyTrip, OYO’s average rating is 3.5 on 5, and the majority of our hotels are 4-plus in terms of their ratings and services."
"Q. But how do you ensure quality when you are merely supplying customers to a hotel owner who runs the business. Like in the Bollywood movie Khosla ka Ghosla, one can ask OYO—“Aap party ho ya broker? ( Are you the principal or the agent?)”"
"From a consumer perspective, our proposition is very simple—low cost, reliable quality, and most importantly, owning the “end to end experience”. Whether it is a late checkout request, an early check-in, breakfast or any other service, if you booked a hotel room through an online travel agent, the OTA will ask you to discuss with the owner directly."
"For us, being “party” or the principal is very critical. As far as the consumer is concerned, OYO is the party. Therefore, we should take decisions like a party so the consumer is assured that they don’t need to worry about what they can or can’t do."
"That said, there are two parts of our experience that we have seen complaints over and are things that we want to improve."
The first is check-in experience. Sometimes you’ve heard about customers saying “I reached the hotel and I didn’t get the room”; “I was stranded”. That is evil. That is unacceptable.
"There are some practical reasons this happened. For example, if there’s a medical customer who says that I don’t want to check out, but the hotel has sold to capacity, you’ll have to say no to a customer. So what we’ve done now is adopted a new policy. One strike and a hotel gets deprioritised 50%, two times and the hotel gets removed from the OYO platform."
"We have also made this a top area of accountability for all our group CEOs—their bonuses are linked to this. Over the last three months, you’d have seen these issues, even on social media, would have crashed."
"The second focus is sometimes you have customers complaining that OYO gave a poor-quality hotel that didn’t deserve to be in the OYO network. Now, the first thing that people sometimes get wrong is thinking that we do no work before we go to a hotel. We put in a lot of effort. There is a 140-point checklist before we put up the OYO signage. We have an app to track how these potential hotel partners score, we have multiple levels of people go and visit the hotel physically to check and validate things."
Are there places where we’ve gotten the check operationally wrong or whether certain city benchmarks differed from other cities? Yes.
"What have we done to make those changes? One, we’ve launched an ops bodyguard program, where there is one more check beyond the 140-point checklist. We exited 200 cities in the beginning of the year where we had one or two hotels, where we just found that the supply was just not ready to deliver the experience on OYO.That, by revenue, impacted us by like 1.5 to 2%. But that 1.5%, the noise that it would bring was disproportionate."
"And the third one is we’ll try to help all our partners. But we saw that in some places, we just could not provide work with a partner for alignment. Even those were removed. We announced the 10,000 rooms-removal in December."
"Q. Complaints about OYO have not just been from customers, right? Over the last year or so, there have also been many vociferous complaints from your hotel partners. Firstly, in terms of contracts, with people saying that money was never paid as per contractual commitments. And secondly that there was no recourse—hotel partners didn’t have access to the right channels to complain or rectify those issues or it would just go into the ether, but nobody actually responded from OYO. Do you recognise these as genuine problems? If so, how are you planning to fix it?"
"First off, what are the things we added for our partners? You’d find it very hard to find a lot of partners that will come and complain about the occupancy of OYO. The second thing is OYO OS and the technologies that we bring. And the third is the repeat rate. These are three things that really added value."
"Before I talk about the two problems that you laid out, let me share some complexity that we face in our business when we engage with our partners."
"The first one is that the majority of our partners are good people. Now, among them, there is some percentage of owners who may sometimes try to short-circuit contracts. For example, there are roughly 25% owners who have said that there has never been any walk-ins at their hotel in their history with OYO. It is slightly unrealistic to believe this."
"So, due to that, we will launch a policy of saying that we are going to ensure that going forward, we will have auditors go to the hotel. Or we will basically launch a policy to say that because the customer service is not good, after a certain number of complaints, there will be a fine."
"Now, what happens is that disagreements creep in for those specific policies or systems. And those policies or systems disagreements lead to friction with partners. That’s one reason for friction. The second is the price point-volume equation and unrealistic expectations that we could have, in hindsight, managed better."
"So, what else could we have done better? Improve our relative ability to resolve issues. Earlier, our owners will give the job of accounting to their CA or the accountant, and their accountant would like to have a discussion with OYO’s accountant. Whenever discussions are non-principal to non-principal, it’s incredibly hard to make resolutions happen."
"With ‘Sambandh’, our new partner-focused initiative, 100% of OYO business development officers were trained to do reconciliation. So, the person who signs the contract will also know the exact accounting system and they will engage with the owner directly. The owner’s accountant is free to sit in the same room, so that it is now principal to principal. So that, in my view, is a problem that has been solved significantly. I wouldn’t say it’s 100%, but I would say 95% plus of the resolution situation has improved."
"But that said, the three things we could have, we will do better, and have been doing since January. These are things that we did along with the "
restructuring in January
". The first is in our deal constructs; we need to not just simplify our deal constructs, but also the reconciliation statements. And we have simplified both of those."
"The second; you may have heard that Flipkart, Ola, and a lot of these companies change their policies by means of electronic notifications, emails, and messages. In our situation, that has not worked."
"Because when we send electronic messages for policy updates or changes, our partners sometimes don’t read them. So we have taken steps to ensure that our partners have actually received and understood the contract changes. One improvement we need to make is to speak to every partner before the final change is done and take more time. Instead of one month, maybe we can give two or three months before making a change."
"I think, overall, we grew a bit "
faster than ideal in 2019
" and along the way, some shortcuts were taken and some mistakes made. We are now cognisant of these and are taking steps to fix them."
"Q. Now if we could rewind the clock a bit, I want to take us back to one of the first stories we did about OYO, one in which we asked "
if OYO was a Ponzi scheme
" in that it could easily be gamed by ingredients like minimum guarantees, partial inventory, deeply-discounted room rates and reporting on vanity metrics like “booked room nights”. So much so that your take rates, and therefore, your revenue, were negative. How would you respond to that?"
"I think, first off, we should look at it from today’s position. Over the last three years or so, starting from early 2017, we started moving very significantly towards full inventory. I think I’d announced in 2017 that 80-90% of our supply had moved to full inventory supply. A full inventory supply, combined with positive take, which is visible from our filings as well, eliminates the loophole of gaming the system using the partial inventory model."
"The second bit is our room-rate pricing being very low. That was, is, and will remain only a very low single-digit percentage of transactions. Number three; on a full year basis, we have always been able to generate a positive take rate even if it was very low earlier. Over time, it has increased because of the various system changes and an increased value proposition to consumers and partners."
"Also at that time, we used to report the “booked room nights” metric externally because that is what other peers were doing. Internally, this was never a metric that our team was concerned about and instead, we were firmly focused on “used room nights”."
"Finally, regarding minimum guarantees. For us, minimum guarantees were always a thin wedge that we used to open up relationships with new partners, both domestically in India as well as in new markets. Our plan was to use minimum guarantees to give ourselves the flexibility to set pricing for hotel rooms and thus improve occupancy by matching supply and demand dynamically."
"As of today, the majority of our partner relationships are based on revenue sharing and we only have 2-3% of contracts as minimum guarantees. Also, even earlier, there were only a small percentage of properties that would significantly account for minimum guarantee losses. Over time, each, if not every, such partnership would be net accretive to us from a revenue perspective."
"Q. Ok, now can we talk about the elephant in the room—the Covid pandemic? How has the pandemic impacted OYO and what are you doing in response?"
"Sure. Look, first of all, there is no question that we are heavily impacted, given the crisis that it has brought with itself. India, specifically, because there is a nationwide lockdown right now, and it doesn’t seem like it’s going to get better as we speak."
"From my perspective, there are a few important areas. The first one is to make sure that we are prepared to ensure that our partners need us more than ever before today. So it’s critical that we can prepare our partner ecosystem. The first thing in the path that we are preparing is a ‘sanitised stay’ tag in our hotels. We have set up a bunch of policies right from entry at the hotel, check in, in-room service and housekeeping, check out, baggage collection and baggage departure."
"For each part of the experience, we are working to make sure that we are prepared. At this point in time, it is still difficult to predict in what direction the business is going to go. But, we are seeing some early greenshoots in markets like China, where we have now reached occupancy of 45%, up from 20% or so during the peak of the pandemic."
"Q. In the post-Covid world, hotel partners will be faced with challenges they have never seen before. How will you help them? What are you doing to strengthen your relationship with asset owners?"
"Covid-19 is having a huge impact on the entire hospitality industry worldwide, with occupancy rates plunging. We are taking several measures to assist and support our asset owners across the country:"
"Lessening the burden of payments due and accrue; multiple charges have been waived for the month of March onwards, including value-added service charges, Wizard membership accruals, etc. Under these initiatives, a total of Rs 24 crore (US$3.1 million) discounts has already been offered to over 3,000 OYO partners and continues to impact several others."
"At the same time, thousands of partners who wanted to become a part of OYO Secure—a financial product similar to an online wallet for simplified deal benefits and real-time visibility of their earnings—were offered support. Support in terms of reduced joining amounts as well as a complimentary 30% top-up from OYO for every recharge to the asset owner’s OYO Secure wallet."
"March onwards, irrespective of past dues at the property, we continue to make weekly payments and reconciliation settlements. This is helping thousands of partners immensely with managing working capital requirements."
"We have also partnered with multiple lending institutions in India, ranging from non-banking financial institutions (NBFCs), private sector banks, new-age fintech companies to identify and facilitate adequate financing for hotel transformation, upgradation, capex, and working capital requirements. Over the past few months, the disbursals under these renovation and up-gradation advances have crossed over Rs 160 crore (US$21 million).The company’s partnership with these institutions helps fast track the loan process while reducing processing time as well as documentation delays. Starting April, we also launched a retention-linked discount for certain sections of asset owners. The discounts range from 50% on base fees for April and May and an extended discount of 20-25% across June-December."
Certain services for a large section of eligible asset owners are also being provided free of charge for the said period. These include Free Tariff Manager Value Added Services
"Through these fiscal relief and support measures as well as OYO Sambandh, we are maintaining a constant line of communication with our partners."
Q. How do you see all these initiatives actually impacting your economics? Who is bearing the cost for all this?
"The first thing is the cost structure linked to a lot of these programmes is not very significant. For a long time, the hospitality industry has sort of operated with higher cost structures than it should. Like how over-staffing is a visible issue. And if you think that you’re just seeing this in businesses which are four-star, five-star, you’re mistaken."
"Partly because of the cost structure reduction, and partly due to the migrant crisis, this is not going to do anymore. Hotels will have to learn to operate with significantly lower cost structures and we are going to be very focused in enabling that for our hotel partners."
"So if you see the occupancy report from our China business, you will see that the budget and mid-market hotels have been able to ramp up the occupancy to ~45-50% levels. Whereas the luxury hotels are still loitering in the 13-14% range. And this is something that we believe we will see in most markets across the world, that the economy hotels will be the first one to come out, partly because of the young people who will have a higher need and will be less risk-averse comparatively."
"But coming back to cost, we hope we can help our partners in four important areas. This is what we call the OYO partner survival programme."
"The first one is helping our partners negotiate their leases in a more fair manner. Because if you have negotiated your leases at a RevPar of 900, when the new RevPar is going to be 700 or 600, you will not make money. But it’s also unfair to expect your owner to give you a new lease and not expect a recovery in the future. So we are helping our partners come up with a lease programme. It is a fixed-plus-variable programme, where you say “RevPar isgoing to drop, so give me a base amount”. But as the RevPar increases, OYO will directly give transparent visibility to the owner and the lease will keep increasing."
"The second, reducing operating expenses, like I mentioned. Third is ensuring that we bring sanitisation and trust to the underlying hotel owner. And the fourth is enabling debts or loans by the MSME (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) programme of the government or by means of NBFC partners that we may have, to be able to let them scale their business themselves."
Q. And what about OYO itself? What are your plans for the next 12 months? What are the top three things that you’re doing to make sure that you survive or thrive in this pandemic and after?
"Last year, 2019, we saw significant growth. We served a lot more customers and partners; we brought in a lot of employees than we ever did in the history of our company—many multiples right?"
"But that said, this gives us an opportunity to really get back and get deeper to say: How do we make sure every customer who comes to OYO gets a great experience? How do we make sure we build deeper bridges with a partner?"
"And third is with our employees. This is the time to really have deep engagement with our employees and build the culture and the values of our company that we stand for, which is very hard to be able to share with three or four times the number of people in six months. But now gives us an opportunity to over invest and spend the time to do that."
"Of course, we are also making sure that we are prudent about all controllable costs, including capex, marketing, any significant additional expenditures that we may have. The most unfortunate thing… is right after a restructuring in January, having to unfortunately follow through with some furloughs at this point of time. That has been the toughest thing at this point of time. But again, I think that was something that needed to be done to ensure that we get through the crisis and come out stronger."
"Now the growth will definitely change. If the growth was 200% or 300%, it may come down. It may not be that triple-digit percentage, maybe 60%, or maybe 80%. Something in that range. In today’s world, growth is not at the top of my mind. To survive, serve your key stakeholders, recover, and then grow, is. My belief is we are still left with, after the cost structure changes that we’ve done, a significant amount of firepower for incremental growth."
"Q. Tragic as the pandemic has been, it is, in a sense, bringing to the fore, two strengths that OYO has. First, capital as a moat, given that you have more than US$1 billion of dry powder. Secondly, increased leverage with hotel partners since many hotels might be looking to partner with companies like yours in these uncertain times."
"Regarding the capital, the goal at this point of time is to see through the crisis by serving our consumers and our partners. And when the world comes back, keep a decent amount of capital available so that we can invest in growth at that point of time."
"The second one is where we see opportunity in two ways; first with new owners and the second with old owners. With new owners, to build and forge relationships, especially in locations where we’ve always wanted to be, and we could not find opportunity to get into. This is what we are seeing in China, for example, post-Covid. Earlier, we had challenges in China, but Covid seems to have really reset people’s minds in every manner."
"Q. One of the most talked about fundings of last year was when you borrowed US$2 billion to invest into OYO alongside SoftBank. Doesn’t that put you on a ticking time bomb, at least from one sense, that now you need to think about your own loan and making sure that margin call does not happen? As opposed to wondering about what is good for the company, maybe, at that point of time. Does OYO need to save Ritesh Agarwal, rather than the other way around?"
That’s a fair question. The view I have is I think I’m invested in building OYO for the very long term.
"For me, building OYO and making this successful is the most important thing. And I am not just saying this—I am putting my money where my mouth is. Remember that I have not sold a single share of mine in any secondary so far, and it’s not like I have a ton of savings. The only money I have is that loan, which also sits in a holding company that I cannot use to pay for my normal expenses."
"So if I were to look at my personal situation—on paper, the wealth may be worth whatever, but the actual savings situation would be very, very slim. But I don’t mind it."
"Q. Speaking of SoftBank, what has happened? You were the blue-eyed boy of the SoftBank portfolio, you’re the company that they’re most bullish about. But is that still the case or after WeWork has that changed? How is your personal equation with Masayoshi Son now?"
"Look, for me, most of my discussions with SoftBank are actually at the board level. There are two primary board members who are there from SoftBank—Munish Verma and Gerry Lopez."
"I think, for SoftBank, they continue to be committed to the OYO opportunity. Of course, they recognise that in the short-term, our business will be impacted due to the Covid scenario, but at the end of the day, they believe that this is a very foundational business. Even at a time like now, OYO is able to generate a significant amount of revenues, gross margins. And when I say significant, it’s not better than pre-Covid, it is definitely a 50-plus-percent drop. But even a 50-plus-percent drop is better than the 80-90% drop that other hotel chains have seen globally."
"Q. So what is success for you? You said that this is clearly not about the money and you would have at least cashed out at least some portion of this secondary, you’d think, so what matters to you?"
"For me, the happiest feeling is to see a difference in one of the three sets of people—the employees, the customers, or the partners. Unfortunately, I have not done such a great job for partners so far, in the last year at least. Before that, we had done a great job; last year has been some temporary aberration and we need to improve. For employees, after five years of clear leadership as a top employer brand, I understand that, in the short-term at least, we are facing some challenges because of the restructuring. But my view is, being able to make sure that for these three stakeholders, I can make a big impact."
